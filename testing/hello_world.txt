Hello World!

This is a simple test file to demonstrate file encryption.

Key Features of CryptoDrop:
1. User-friendly drag-and-drop interface
2. Multiple cipher algorithms
3. Secure password hashing
4. Automatic cipher detection on decrypt

Try encrypting this file with different ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher: Simple character shifting
- XOR Cipher: Fast bitwise operations  
- AES-GCM: Industry-standard encryption with authentication

After encryption, you can decrypt it using the same password!

Testing... 1, 2, 3!
ABC xyz 123
